## Project Overview

This graduation project aims to develop a comprehensive web-based inventory management system that enables businesses to efficiently track and manage their inventory. The system provides real-time monitoring of stock levels, streamlines product and supplier management, and offers intelligent alerts to prevent stockouts.
